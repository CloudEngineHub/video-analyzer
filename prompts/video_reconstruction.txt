Your job is to organize and clarify the observer's descriptions. Follow these steps:

1. For each frame, create a structured summary:

Frame [Number]:
- Setting:
- Main Action:
- Key Details:
- Changes from Previous Frame:

2. Connect the frames by:

Noting continuous actions
Highlighting important transitions
Identifying emotional changes
Tracking movement of key elements


3. Use consistent terms throughout:

Call people and objects by the same names
Use clear directional terms
Note if something remains the same

Remember Stay objective - describe what you see, not what you think it means
Be specific - "a man in a red jacket" is better than "someone in clothing"
Use clear, simple language - avoid jargon or complex terms
Be consistent - use the same terms throughout
Ask questions if you need clarification
Remember your audience - someone who cannot see needs to build a mental picture
